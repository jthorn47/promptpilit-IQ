3. **Gamification Data**: No test data in leaderboard/achievements tables

### Medium Priority:
1. **OpenAI Integration**: API key configuration needed for full AI features
2. **Email Integration**: CRM email functionality requires SMTP setup
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Custom report builder needs additional development

### Low Priority:
1. **UI Polish**: Some hover effects could be smoother
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Kanban board needs mobile optimization
3. **Additional Filters**: More granular filtering options for large datasets
