## üé® Tour Integration Guidelines

### **Implementation Notes**
- **Framework Compatibility:** Scripts work with Intro.js, Shepherd.js, Driver.js, and similar tour libraries
- **Responsive Design:** All element selectors should work across desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- **Accessibility:** Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Customization:** Modify descriptions and selectors to match your exact component structure

### **CSS Selector Guidelines**
```css
/* Ensure tour-targeted elements have stable selectors */
#payroll-dashboard-header { /* Main headers */ }
.summary-metrics { /* Metric cards */ }
.quick-actions-section { /* Action button groups */ }
.activity-timeline { /* Activity feeds */ }
.deadlines-widget { /* Deadline components */ }

/* Add data attributes for stability */
[data-tour="step-1"] { /* Tour-specific targeting */ }
[data-testid="payroll-button"] { /* Test-friendly selectors */ }
```

### **Brand Voice Guidelines**
- **Tone:** Professional, helpful, encouraging
- **Language:** Clear, action-oriented, jargon-free
- **Length:** Keep descriptions under 25 words for optimal readability
- **Personality:** Confident guide, not overwhelming teacher

### **Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] Test all element selectors in development
- [ ] Verify tour flow on different screen sizes
- [ ] Include skip/exit options for experienced users
- [ ] Add progress indicators for longer tours
- [ ] Test with screen readers for accessibility
- [ ] Create tour completion tracking for analytics
